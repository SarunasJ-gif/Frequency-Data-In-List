The program calculate the number frequency in a list.
Given a list of integers A, print the appearance frequency of each number in the list.
Example:

```
A = [1, 4, 1, 5, 8, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 3, 7, 2]
```

Output:

```
Number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Frequency: 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1
```

The program accept list A as an argument in the command line.
The number line contains all the numbers from min(A) to max(A) even if it does not appear
in A (e.g., 6). Numbers in the two lines are aligned.
Also the program draw a graph similar to the one below:

```
*
